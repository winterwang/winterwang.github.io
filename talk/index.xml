      <description>Recent evidence suggests that there are three types of eaters (grazers, early eaters, and late eaters) according to the timing of energy consumption[1,2]. This study aims at finding both timing and quantity eating patterns specifically for carbohydrate (CH) intake in UK adults. Data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) Rolling Programme (2008&amp;frasl;09-15&amp;frasl;16) included 6155 adults aged 19 or older in the UK. Time of the day was categorized into 7 slots: 6-9 am, 9-12 noon, 12-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, 8-10 pm and 10 pm-6 am.</description>
