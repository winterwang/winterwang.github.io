### Introduction
Changing time trends in the prevalence of _H.pylori_ infection in the general population is thought to be the main driving force behind the declined gastric cancer mortality in Japan. However, whether the prevalence of H.pylori infection itself showed a birth cohort pattern remains inadequately studied. 
### Methods
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of _H.pylori_ infection among Japanese subjects. Potential studies eligible for inclusion included population-based cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and case-control studies. Sources of between-study heterogeneity were explored a meta-regression model. The multivariate adjusted prevalence of _H.pylori_ infection (95% confidence intervals, CI) by birth year was estimated using spline methods in the framework of the generalized additive model.
### Results
42 studies reported the prevalence of _H.pylori_ infection in at least two age groups were included. Most of the studies were conducted in health screening, outpatient, or community settings. A high heterogeneity was observed across studies (p<0.0001), with the birth year being the only source of between-study heterogeneity. The prevalence of _H.pylori_ infection exhibited a clear birth cohort pattern: the multivariate adjusted prevalence (%, 95% CI) was 65.3 (63.8-66.8), 61.5 (60.1-62.9), 55.7 (54.9-56.6), 46.1 (45.4-46.7), 30.3 (29.1-31.6), 22.1 (20.8-23.6), 14.8 (12.3-17.1), and 8.7 (5.9-12.6) among those who were born in 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively. Specifically, the prevalence among children who were born after the year 2000 was less than 10%. 
### Conclusions
The present meta-analysis showed a clear birth cohort pattern of _H.pylori_ infection in Japan. The decreased prevalence of H.pylori infection in successive generations should be weighed in future gastric cancer control programs.
