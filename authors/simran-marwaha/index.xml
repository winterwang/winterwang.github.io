      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; This study evaluated the level of burden in pediatric and adolescent atopic dermatitis (AD) patients in Japan, the associated burden on caregivers/families, and whether this burden varied with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Data were drawn from the Adelphi Pediatric AD Disease Specific Programme (DSP)™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians and their patients conducted in Japan between July and December 2022. Physicians reported patient demographics, clinical characteristics, disease burden, and current/previous therapies. Patients and/or caregivers reported perceived disease severity and impact of AD, including the Children&amp;rsquo;s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) and Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire (DFI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Overall, 55 physicians provided data for 537 AD patients aged ≤17. Mean (SD) overall scores for CDLQI, POEM, and DFI were 9.3 (6.3), 8.3 (6.8), and 11.7 (7.2), respectively. Age was associated with higher patient and/or caregiver-reported CDLQI scores, which increased by 0.543 points per year of age (P = 0.01). Patients with severe disease reported a more significant impact on quality of life factors compared with mild patients (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Age was associated with higher caregiver-reported burden, with DFI scores increasing by 0.325 per year (P = 0.01). Physician-reported impact on caregivers showed that age was significantly associated with increased burden on sleep, daily activities, work, and mood (P &amp;lt; 0.05), with disease severity associated with impact across all factors (P &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;: Both increasing age and disease severity were associated with the increased impact of AD on patients and their caregivers. Disease control/modification through appropriate therapeutic intervention at a younger age may relieve the burden of pediatric AD on patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
