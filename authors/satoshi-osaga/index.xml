      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a rare form of lymphoma in Japan. This study aimed to explore hematologists&amp;rsquo; motivations and considerations in making treatment decisions for CLL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Responses from hematologists treating CLL, obtained through an online survey, were descriptively analyzed. Subgroup analyses by preferred first-line (1L) treatment, years of clinical experience, and level of interest in CLL were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Out of 107 hematologists surveyed, 82.2% identified Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) as their primary choice for 1L treatment; the reasons included established clinical evidence (61.4%) and oral administration convenience (56.8%). Key factors influencing 1L treatment selection among those favoring BTKi included the presence of 17p deletion, TP53 mutation, and patient&amp;rsquo;s fitness status. BTKi was favored by 92.6% of hematologists with &amp;lt; 10 years of clinical experience and by 78.8% with more experience. The main reasons for choosing BTKi included safety (50.0%) and tolerance (46.7%) among hematologists who stated they had a specific interest in CLL and the oral administration route (62.1%) among hematologists with lower interest. When BTKi was used as 1L therapy, venetoclax-based regimens were preferred for second-line treatment. The most common concern about BTKi was substantial out-of-pocket costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;: Although many Japanese hematologists select their treatment based on clinical evidence, variations exist in treatment strategies, possibly associated with hematologists&amp;rsquo; experience and interest in CLL. These findings underscore the importance of further promoting evidence-based treatments to ensure that all physicians can make informed decisions. Future research should explore additional factors that influence CLL treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Online survey; Treatment selection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Treatment persistence of interleukin-17 inhibitor class drugs among patients with psoriasis in Japan: a retrospective database study</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background and objective&lt;/strong&gt;: Real-world evidence on persistence of interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) as a drug class among Japanese patients with psoriasis is lacking. Hence, we aimed to describe persistence rates of IL-17is among patients with psoriasis including psoriasis vulgaris (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) or erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: We analyzed claims data from the Medical Data Vision database. Patients ≥15 years old with a psoriasis diagnosis and an IL-17i prescription between November 2016 and August 2020 were included and followed through August 2021. Persistence rates of the IL-17i class among patients with psoriasis and its subtypes (PsO, PsA, and GPP or EP), and persistence rates of ixekizumab, secukinumab, or brodalumab among patients with PsO or PsA were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Analyses were conducted in the bio-naïve and bio-experienced subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: The IL-17i class had &amp;gt;50% persistence rates up to 36 months among patients with psoriasis and its subtypes (PsO, PsA, and GPP or EP). 36-Month persistence rates for ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab were 46.2% to 57.7% in patients with PsO and 43.0% to 48.4% in patients with PsA. Across analyses, bio-naïve patients demonstrated similar or greater persistence rates than bio-experienced patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: IL-17is&amp;rsquo; persistence rates over 36 months were &amp;gt;50% among patients with psoriasis and its subtypes (PsO, PsA, and GPP or EP) in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: IL-17 inhibitor; Psoriasis vulgaris; erythrodermic psoriasis; generalized pustular psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; treatment persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
