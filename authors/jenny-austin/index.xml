      <title>Patient and family burden in pediatric atopic dermatitis and its treatment pattern in Japan</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; This study evaluated the level of burden in pediatric and adolescent atopic dermatitis (AD) patients in Japan, the associated burden on caregivers/families, and whether this burden varied with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Data were drawn from the Adelphi Pediatric AD Disease Specific Programme (DSP)™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians and their patients conducted in Japan between July and December 2022. Physicians reported patient demographics, clinical characteristics, disease burden, and current/previous therapies. Patients and/or caregivers reported perceived disease severity and impact of AD, including the Children&amp;rsquo;s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) and Dermatitis Family Impact questionnaire (DFI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Overall, 55 physicians provided data for 537 AD patients aged ≤17. Mean (SD) overall scores for CDLQI, POEM, and DFI were 9.3 (6.3), 8.3 (6.8), and 11.7 (7.2), respectively. Age was associated with higher patient and/or caregiver-reported CDLQI scores, which increased by 0.543 points per year of age (P = 0.01). Patients with severe disease reported a more significant impact on quality of life factors compared with mild patients (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Age was associated with higher caregiver-reported burden, with DFI scores increasing by 0.325 per year (P = 0.01). Physician-reported impact on caregivers showed that age was significantly associated with increased burden on sleep, daily activities, work, and mood (P &amp;lt; 0.05), with disease severity associated with impact across all factors (P &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;: Both increasing age and disease severity were associated with the increased impact of AD on patients and their caregivers. Disease control/modification through appropriate therapeutic intervention at a younger age may relieve the burden of pediatric AD on patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of Patient and Physician Disconnect on Satisfaction with Treatment for Atopic Dermatitis in Japan</title>
      <link>https://wangcc.me/publication/journal-article/adsatisfy/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory disease causing severe skin itching. Data on patient-physician disconnect on treatment satisfaction in patients with AD in Japan are limited. We investigated patient-physician disconnect on treatment satisfaction in AD and if it influences treatment patterns, clinical characteristics, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Data were drawn from the Adelphi AD Disease Specific Programme (DSP), a real-world, point-in-time survey of physicians and patients with AD conducted in Japan from April to July 2019. Patients and physicians were grouped according to level of treatment satisfaction (&amp;ldquo;extremely satisfied&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;extremely dissatisfied&amp;rdquo;); with any level of dissatisfaction recorded as &amp;ldquo;less than satisfied.&amp;rdquo; Data were collected on treatment patterns, clinical characteristics, and PROs including the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: Data were provided by 184 patients with AD and 56 physicians; 72.8% of patient-physician pairs reported a fair (kappa coefficient: 0.40) level of agreement on treatment satisfaction, 51.6% of patient-physician pairs were both satisfied, and 21.2% were both less than satisfied. Satisfied physicians prescribed a mean 1.2 fewer treatments than dissatisfied physicians (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Cases where both physician and patient were less than satisfied or where patients were less satisfied than their physicians reported the worst PROs, DLQI (both less than satisfied: mean 10.7 versus patient less satisfied than physician: 10.6 versus overall: 7.9), POEM (19.5 versus 17.3 versus 17.0), EQ-5D-3L (0.82 versus 0.81 versus 0.87) (all, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Work impairment was highest when both patient and physician were less than satisfied (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Physicians cited treatment efficacy and patients cited efficacy and usability as main reasons for dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Overall, 12.0% of patients were less satisfied with their AD treatment than the physician, demonstrating some of the worst PROs, suggesting unmet need that could be improved by better patient-physician communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Atopic dermatitis; Disconnect; Japan; Patient; Physician; Satisfaction; Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
