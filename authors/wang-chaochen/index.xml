      <title>Alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk in Japan: a pooled analysis of eight population-based cohort studies</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although alcohol consumption is reported to increase the incidence of breast cancer in European studies, evidence for an association between alcohol and breast cancer in Asian populations is insufficient. We conducted a pooled analysis of eight large-scale population-based prospective cohort studies in Japan to evaluate the association between alcohol (both frequency and amount) and breast cancer risk with categorization by menopausal status at baseline and at diagnosis. Estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated in the individual cohorts and combined using random-effects models. Among 158,164 subjects with 2,369,252 person-years of follow-up, 2,208 breast cancer cases were newly diagnosed. Alcohol consumption had a significant association with a higher risk of breast cancer in both women who were premenopausal at baseline (regular drinker compared to non-drinker: HR 1.37, 1.04-1.81, ≥23g/day compared to 0g/day: HR 1.74, 1.25-2.43, P for trend per frequency category: P=0.017) and those who were premenopausal at diagnosis (≥23g/day compared to 0g/day: HR 1.89, 1.04-3.43, P for trend per frequency category: P=0.032). In contrast, no significant association was seen in women who were postmenopausal at baseline or at diagnosis, despite a substantial number of subjects and long follow-up period. Our results revealed that frequent and high alcohol consumption are both risk factors for Asian premenopausal breast cancer, similarly to previous studies in Western countries. The lack of a clear association in postmenopausal women in this study warrants larger investigation in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid urine antibody test for Helicobacter pylori infection in adolescents</title>
      <link>https://wangcc.me/publication/journal-article/okuda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Since &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; infection in adolescents or young adults shows few symptoms, screening tests are necessary for this population. In this study, the accuracy of the rapid urine-&lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; antibody (u-HpAb) test was evaluated and compared to that of urine and serum &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA, respectively) in junior high school students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 1,225 students attending the junior high schools in Sasayama city were invited to participate in this study. Urine and blood samples were assayed for anti-&lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; immunoglobulin G antibodies, and rapid u-HpAb was performed by three investigators independently. When the judgment of all investigators was in accordance, a positive or negative result was defined. Discrepant judgment was defined as an undetermined result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 187 students participated in this study and provided both urine and blood samples. Three students showed undetermined results with rapid u-HpAb. Excluding these results, the positivity rate of rapid u-HpAb was 3.3% (6/184), whereas that for u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA was 4.8% (10/187) and 5.9% (11/187), respectively. Using s-HpELISA and u-HpELISA as the standards, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of rapid u-HpAb were 85.7%, 100%, 100%, and 99.4%, respectively when excluding the undetermined results of rapid u-HpAb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid urine-HpAb test had excellent specificity but relatively low sensitivity.
