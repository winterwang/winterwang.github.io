  abstract   = {Objective We aimed to determine whether complement 3 (C3) is positively related to the degree of liver fat content in healthy Japanese adults. Method Middle-aged male subjects who drank less than 46 g/day alcohol (n=40) were studied. H1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to quantify liver fat content, (3T, Siemens MR, TE=30 ms). Volume of interest was selected in the right liver lobe with a size of 4Ã4Ã4 cm. The spectrogram was analyzed by LCModel. Results Mean age and body mass index were 61.8 years and 24.0 kg/m2. The geometric mean and 95\% confidence interval of C3 (mg/dl) in the lowest, medium, and highest liver fat tertile were 96.5 (92.8, 100.5), 111.1 (104.6, 115.6), 112.2 (106.7, 117.9), respectively after adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake and blood FFA level (one-way ANCOVA p = 0.008 inear p = 0.010). Conclusion We found a linear and positive relationship between C3 and liver fat content. Present fi ndings may implicate hepatocyte injury already present with accumulation of triacylglycerol.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation, may be involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether inflammation precedes development of T2DM independent of cigarette smoking and obesity remains to be confirmed.
METHODS: We studied 4213 civil servants in a local government in Japan aged 35-66âyears at baseline in 2002, who donated blood samples and were followed 6âyears. Hazard ratios (HR) of T2DM according to the hs-CRP quartiles [range Q1: 0.02-0.18 (reference), Q2: 0.18-0.33, Q3: 0.33-0.67 and Q4: 0.67-9.62âmg/L) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking status (current, past and never), number of cigarettes per day, physical activity, family history of diabetes (Model 1) and variables in Model 1â+âglucose (Model 2).
RESULTS: The geometric mean [95\% confidence interval (CI)] of hs-CRP was 0.36âmg/L (0.34-0.37). During the follow-up, 156 new T2DM cases were confirmed. In total sample, Model 2 HRs (95\% CIs) for hs-CRP quartiles Q2-Q4 compared with Q1 were 0.69 (0.36-1.26), 1.47 (0.91-2.39) and 1.78 (1.10-2.88), respectively (p for linear trendâ=â0.014). Stratified analysis revealed that a statistically significant association was observed only in normal weight non-current smokers with Model 2 HRs (CIs) being 0.79 (0.29-2.17), 2.63 (1.25-5.56) and 3.19 (1.49-6.86) for Q2-Q4 compared with Q1, respectively (p for linear trendâ=â0.0006). The relationship did not change materially after further adjusting for log-homeostasis model assessment or exclusion of past smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply that higher hs-CRP itself or existence of chronic systemic inflammation precedes onset of T2DM independent of obesity and smoking.},

  abstract   = {Cardiovascular health metrics were defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2010 to reduce deaths from cardiovascular diseases by 20\% in a decade. This study aims to examine relationships between dietary health metrics and results of health checkups in Japanese workers. We studied 3,446 Japanese civil servants in Aichi prefecture, aged 35-66 years in 2002. Subjects were divided by tertile of each dietary item intake; the third tertile of fruits and vegetables, and fish intakes, the first tertile of salt and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intakes, and everyday intake of fiber-rich whole grain were considered as ideal intakes. We adjusted for sex, age, smoking habit, leisure-time and work-related physical activities, alcohol intake, and other dietary health metrics as potential confounders, and BMI as a mediator. Lower fruits and vegetables, and higher salt and SSB intakes, as well as lower number of dietary health metrics met, were associated with poor health checkup results most likely by increasing body mass index (BMI). Fish intake was inversely associated with triglycerides and positively with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of BMI. Intake of fiber-rich whole grain was not associated with any health checkup results. In conclusion, AHA dietary health metrics were associated with blood pressure and lipids in a Japanese sample. In particular, fish and SSB intakes were associated with multiple abnormalities, but the associations of SSB were largely explained by its association with BMI. In order to form future plans for non-communicable disease prevention in Japan, measures against insufficient fish intake and over-consumption of SSB are thought to be important.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: To examine the association of intrahepatic fat with homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a marker of insulin resistance, in Japanese adults, and whether intrahepatic fat is associated with insulin resistance independent of waist circumference and other measures of obesity.
METHODS: Fifty-three individuals aged 37-69 were studied. Spectrum obtained using a 3-T magnetic resonance imager was analysed with LCModel to quantify intrahepatic fat. Blood levels of insulin, glucose and other biochemical markers were obtained after 8h or more fasting. Percent body fat was estimated by a bioelectrical impedance analyzer. HOMA-IR and intrahepatic fat content were log-transformed in the analysis.
RESULTS: We found a positive correlation between intrahepatic fat and HOMA-IR, which was independent of the anthropometric measures of obesity. In contrast, significant and positive correlations of body mass index, percent body fat, and waist circumference with HOMA-IR were largely explained by their associations with intrahepatic fat. Intrahepatic fat was positively associated with alanine transaminase and triglycerides even after adjustment for HOMA-IR.
CONCLUSION: Intrahepatic fat was associated with insulin resistance independent of age, sex, and measures of obesity in Japanese adults. Hypertriglyceridemia and liver injury may directly occur subsequent to intrahepatic fat accumulation.},

This study examined the possible mediating effects of adiponectin, leptin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations on the smoking-diabetes association.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, we followed 3338 Japanese workers, aged 35-66 years, who were enrolled in the second Aichi workers' cohort study. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models to determine the hazard ratios and respective 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between smoking status and risk of diabetes. A multiple mediation model with bootstrapping was used to estimate the magnitude and the respective bias-corrected (BC) 95\% CIs of the indirect effects of smoking on diabetes through the three biomarkers.
RESULTS: Relative to never smokers, the risk of diabetes was significantly elevated in current (hazard ratio 1.75, 95\% CI 1.25-2.46) and ex-smokers (hazard ratio 1.54, 95\% CI 1.07-2.22). The indirect effects of smoking on diabetes through adiponectin levels were statistically significant among light (point estimate 0.033, BC 95\% CI 0.005-0.082), moderate (point estimate 0.044, BC 95\% CI 0.010-0.094), and heavy smokers (point estimate 0.054, BC 95\% CI 0.013-0.113). In contrast, neither the indirect effects of smoking on diabetes through leptin nor CRP levels were significant, as the corresponding BC 95\% CIs included zero.
CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, adiponectin concentration appeared to partially mediate the effect of smoking on diabetes, while leptin and CRP levels did not.},

Frequency of eating breakfast was self-reported and was subsequently dichotomized to breakfast skippers, who eat breakfast 3â5 times/week or less, and to eaters. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for potential confounding factors, including dietary factors, smoking and other lifestyles, body mass index (BMI), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) at baseline.Results: During 8.9 years of follow-up, 285 T2DM cases (231 men and 54 women) developed. Compared to participants who reported eating breakfast every day, maximally-adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of those with the frequency of almost every day and 3â5, 1â2, and 0 days/week were: 1.06 (95\% CI, 0.73â1.53), 2.07 (95\% CI, 1.20â3.56), 1.37 (95\% CI, 0.82â2.29), and 2.12 (95\% CI, 1.19â3.76), respectively. In a dichotomized analysis, breakfast skipping was positively associated with T2DM incidence (maximally-adjusted hazard ratio 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.24â2.42). The positive associations were found in both men and women, current and non-current smokers, normal weight and overweight (BMI â¥25 kg/m2), and normal glycemic status and impaired fasting glycemic status (FBG 110 to {\textless}126 mg/dL) individuals at baseline (Ps for interaction all {\textgreater}0.05).Conclusions: The present study in middle-aged Japanese men and women suggests that skipping breakfast may increase the risk of T2DM independent of lifestyles and baseline levels of BMI and FBG.},

However, no studies have been conducted in Japan on this issue. The present study aimed to investigate the association of milk drinking with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in Japan.
METHODS: The data were obtained from the Japan Collaborative Cohort (JACC) study. A total of 94 980 Japanese adults aged 40-79 years who had no history of cancer, stroke, or chronic cardiovascular diseases were followed between 1988 and 2009. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortalities were assessed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model and taking the lowest milk consumption group as the reference.
RESULTS: During a median of 19 years of follow-up, there were 21 775 deaths (28.8\% and 35.3\% from cardiovascular diseases and cancer, respectively). Drinking milk 1-2 times a month was associated with lower all-cause mortality in men compared to those who never drank milk (multivariable-adjusted HR 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.99). In women, those who drank 3-4 times a week also had a lower mortality risk compared with those who never drank milk (HR 0.91; 95\% CI 0.85-0.98). Inverse associations between drinking milk and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancer were found only in men.
CONCLUSIONS: Drinking milk at least 1-2 times a month was associated with lower all-cause mortality in men compared to never drinking milk. An inverse association was also found between drinking milk and mortality from both cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, lower all-cause mortality in women was found only in those who drank milk 3-4 times/week.},

To investigate differences in the association of parental history of diabetes with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the offspring according to the sex of the parent and the offspring's body weight.
Methods
A prospective cohort study of 4446 middle-aged non-diabetic Japanese men and women were followed in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, from 2002 to 2011. Subjects were categorized by their self-reported parental history of diabetes (âno parental history,â âfather only,â âmother only,â and âbothâ). The association of parental history of diabetes and incidence in the offspring was examined according to overweight status adjusted for age, sex, birth weight, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, total energy intake, body mass index, and number of metabolic syndrome components.
Results
During follow-up (median 8.9 years), 277 subjects developed T2DM. Parental history of diabetes was positively associated with T2DM incidence. However, stratified analysis by overweight status revealed that only maternal history was associated with increased T2DM incidence in non-overweight subjects (hazard ratio = 2.35, 95\% confidence interval: 1.41â3.91). While in overweight subjects, paternal history was significantly associated with higher T2DM incidence (hazard ratio = 1.98, 95\% confidence interval: 1.19â3.28).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that parental history of diabetes mellitus is associated with the incidence of T2DM in offspring differently according to the sex of the affected parent and the offspring's body weight.},

  abstract   = {PURPOSE: The extremely high incidence of esophageal cancer in certain rural areas of China has prompted significant intellectual curiosity and research efforts both in China and abroad.
METHODS: We summarize the research progress over the past several decades in high-risk areas (Linxian, Cixian, Shexian, and Yanting) based on literature research and our field trip (2012-2013).
RESULTS: Considerable progress in clarifying the environmental risk factors and pathogenesis of esophageal cancer in high-risk areas has been achieved over the past several decades. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that carcinogen exposure and nutritional deficiency, rather than smoking and drinking, may be the major risk factors for esophageal cancer in the Taihang Mountains region, where the incidence of esophageal cancer is among the highest in the world. Two genome-wide association studies have identified variants in PLCE1 at 10q23 that are significantly associated with esophageal cancer risk. Recent whole-exome studies have revealed a comprehensive mutation pattern, in which the C{\textgreater}T transition is the predominant mutation type.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite extensive research, the main causative factors that contribute to esophageal cancer in high-risk areas have not yet been elucidated. Challenges in this research area include determining the causative role of nitrosamine, identifying other potential carcinogens, and conductingÂ fruitful international collaborative studies based on a multidisciplinary approach. Increased international collaboration will contribute to a better understanding of the etiology of esophageal cancer.},

We assessed whether the impact of each risk factor differed between CHD and stroke mortality in Asians.
METHODS: In total, 104Â 910 subjects aged 40-79 years without histories of cancer, CHD and stroke at baseline were followed between 1988 and 2009. Competing-risks analysis was used to test for differences in the associations of each risk factor with two endpoints (CHD and stroke). Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were also calculated for these endpoints to estimate the population impact of each risk factor.
RESULTS: During a median 19.1-year follow-up, 1554 died from CHD and 3163 from stroke. The association of hypertension with CHD was similar to that with stroke in terms of the magnitude and direction (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for CHD: 1.63 vs. stroke: 1.73 in men and 1.70 vs. 1.66 in women). Conversely, the magnitude of these associations differed for smoking (CHD: 1.95 vs. stroke: 1.23 in men and 2.45 vs. 1.35 in women) and diabetes (1.49 vs. 1.09 in men and 2.08 vs. 1.39 in women). The highest PAF for CHD was caused by smoking in men and by hypertension in women; that for stroke was caused by hypertension in both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension associations and PAFs were consistent between CHD and stroke, but not for other risk factors. These findings may be useful to optimize public health intervention strategies.},

  abstract  = {Background

Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Since H. pylori infection in adolescents or young adults shows few symptoms, screening tests are necessary for this population. In this study, the accuracy of the rapid urine-H. pylori antibody (u-HpAb) test was evaluated and compared to that of urine and serum H. pylori enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA, respectively) in junior high school students.


Methods

All 1,225 students attending the junior high schools in Sasayama city were invited to participate in this study. Urine and blood samples were assayed for anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G antibodies, and rapid u-HpAb was performed by three investigators independently. When the judgment of all investigators was in accordance, a âpositiveâ or ânegativeâ result was defined. Discrepant judgment was defined as an âundeterminedâ result.


Results

In total, 187 students participated in this study and provided both urine and blood samples. Three students showed undetermined results with rapid u-HpAb. Excluding these results, the positivity rate of rapid u-HpAb was 3.3\% (6/184), whereas that for u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA was 4.8\% (10/187) and 5.9\% (11/187), respectively. Using s-HpELISA and u-HpELISA as the standards, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of rapid u-HpAb were 85.7\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 99.4\%, respectively when excluding the undetermined results of rapid u-HpAb.


Conclusions

The rapid urine-HpAb test had excellent specificity but relatively low sensitivity.

Surveys following the WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance were conducted in 2529 adults. Multivariate prevalence ratios (PR) of hypertension for body mass index (BMI) categories were calculated by logistic regression models using conditional standardization procedure. Age- and sex-specified analyses were performed. Overall prevalence of obesity and hypertension were 40.4\% and 46.8\%, respectively. Prevalence of hypertension was positively associated with BMI. However, overweight men had as high prevalence of hypertension as the obese (multivariable-adjusted PR was 1.84 for overweight and 1.91 for obese compared with nonoverweight). The association between hypertension and BMI was similar across age groups. The prevalence of hypertension in women increased gradually with the increase of BMI whereas that in men reached a plateau already in the overweight.},
