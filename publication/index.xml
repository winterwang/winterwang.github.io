      <description>Abstract This study aims at combining time and quantity of carbohydrate (CH) intake in the definition of eating patterns in UK adults and investigating the association of the derived patterns with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) Rolling Program included 6155 adults in the UK. Time of the day was categorized into 7 pre-defined time slots: 6–9 am, 9–12 noon, 12–2 pm, 2–5 pm, 5–8 pm, 8–10 pm, and 10 pm–6 am.</description>

      <description>Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility. We sought to replicate the associations of 61 GWAS-identified SNPs at 42 loci with pancreatic cancer in Japanese and to develop a risk model for the identification of individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer development in the general Japanese population. The model was based on data including directly determined or imputed SNP genotypes for 664 pancreatic cancer case and 664 age- and sex-matched control subjects.</description>

      <description>Abstract Changing trends in the prevalence of H. pylori infection in the general population over time are thought to be the main driving force behind the declining gastric cancer mortality in Japan. However, whether the prevalence of H. pylori infection itself shows a birth-cohort pattern needs to be corroborated. We performed a systematic review of studies that reported the prevalence of H. pylori infection among Japanese individuals. Meta-regression was conducted in the framework of a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to account for heterogeneity in the prevalence of H.</description>

      <description>Background
Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Since H. pylori infection in adolescents or young adults shows few symptoms, screening tests are necessary for this population. In this study, the accuracy of the rapid urine-H. pylori antibody (u-HpAb) test was evaluated and compared to that of urine and serum H. pylori enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA, respectively) in junior high school students.</description>

      <description>Abstract Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, and many risk factors for colorectal cancer have been established. However, it remains uncertain whether psychological stress contributes to the onset of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we conducted a large-scale prospective cohort study to confirm the association between perceived stress and colorectal cancer incidence. We identified 680 cases of colon cancer and 330 cases of rectal cancer during a maximum of 21-year follow-up of 61,563 Japanese men and women.</description>

      <description>Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. However, it remains unproven whether psychological factors have an influence on breast cancer incidence. In our earlier study, subjects possessing two personality traits, decisiveness and “ikigai” (a Japanese word meaning something that makes one’s life worth living), showed a significantly lower risk of developing breast cancer, although no psychological factors have been convincingly demonstrated to have an influence on breast cancer development in other studies.</description>

      <title>Prospective study of seaweed consumption and thyroid cancer incidence in women: the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study.</title>
      <link>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/jaccseaweed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/jaccseaweed/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Excess intake of iodine is a suspected risk factor for thyroid cancer. Previous epidemiological research from Japan reported that daily intake of seaweed was associated with a four-fold higher risk in postmenopausal women, whereas others reported a null association. A major source of iodine intake in Japan is from edible seaweeds, and it is reported to be among the highest in the world. We examined the association between seaweed intake frequency and the risk of thyroid cancer in women in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study followed from 1988 to 2009.</description>

      <guid>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/bfskip/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Background: Skipping breakfast has been suspected as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but the associations are not entirely consistent across ethnicities or sexes, and the issue has not been adequately addressed in the Japanese population.
Methods: We followed 4631 participants (3600 men and 1031 women) in a work-site cohort of participants aged 35–66 years in 2002 through 2011 for T2DM development. Frequency of eating breakfast was self-reported and was subsequently dichotomized to breakfast skippers, who eat breakfast 3–5 times/week or less, and to eaters.</description>

      <title>Smoking and Diabetes: Is the Association Mediated by Adiponectin, Leptin, or C-reactive Protein?</title>
      <link>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/smmd/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/smmd/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Background: Although the association between cigarette smoking and risk of type 2 diabetes is well established, its mechanisms are yet to be clarified. This study examined the possible mediating effects of adiponectin, leptin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations on the smoking-diabetes association.
Methods: Between 2002 and 2011, we followed 3338 Japanese workers, aged 35–66 years, who were enrolled in the second Aichi workers’ cohort study. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models to determine the hazard ratios and respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between smoking status and risk of diabetes.</description>

      <guid>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/milk/</guid>
      <description>Abstract BACKGROUND: Findings regarding the association between milk consumption and all-cause mortality reported by studies carried out in Western populations have been inconsistent. However, no studies have been conducted in Japan on this issue. The present study aimed to investigate the association of milk drinking with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in Japan.
METHODS: The data were obtained from the Japan Collaborative Cohort (JACC) study. A total of 94 980 Japanese adults aged 40-79 years who had no history of cancer, stroke, or chronic cardiovascular diseases were followed between 1988 and 2009.</description>

      <description> 要 約 目的: アメリカ心臓協会(AHA)は、心血管疾患による死亡率を 10 年間で 20%減少させることを目標として、心血管健康度(AHA 指標)を 2010 年に定めた。本研究の目的は、日本人の一集団において、AHA 指標の中の食事・栄養素摂取に関する 5 項目と健診成績との関連を調べることである。
方法および結果: 2002 年に 35-66 歳の愛知県内自治体職員 3,446 人に、簡易型自記式食事歴法質問票を用いて食事調査を実施した。AHA 指標の中で食事・栄養素摂取に関して定められた野菜・果物、魚介類、食物繊維の豊富な全粒穀物、食塩、清涼飲料水の 5 項目の各摂取量に基づいて対象者を三群に分けた。野菜・果物、魚介類は摂取量の最も多い第 3 三分位、食塩、清涼飲料水は最も少ない第 1 三分位を「良好な摂取状況」とみなした。食物繊維の豊富な全粒穀物は玄米・胚芽米・麦・雑穀を「いつも食べる」を「良好な摂取状況」とみなした。これら 5 項目について「良好な摂取状況」の達成項目数別の人数(割合)は、0 項目が 537 人(15.6%)、1 項目が1,453 人(42.2%)、2 項目が 1,029 人(29.9%)、3 項目が 365 人(10.6%)、4 項目以上が 62 人(1.8%)であった。この 5 項目の三分位による摂取量と健診成績との関連性を、性、年齢、喫煙歴、1 週間の運動日数、肉体労働の有無、アルコール摂取量、食事・栄養素摂取項目を調整して検討した。その結果、野菜・果物摂取量は body mass index(BMI)と負の関連、魚介類摂取量は中性脂肪(TG)と負の関連、HDL コレステロール(HDLC)、血糖(PG)と正の関連、食塩摂取量は TG と有意な正の関連、清涼飲料水摂取量は BMI、拡張期血圧(DBP)、総コレステロール(TC)、LDL コレステロール、TG、PG と有意な正の関連を示した。しかし、BMI を調整すると、魚介類と TG、HDLC、PG 以外の上記関連は統計学的有意性が消失した。食物繊維の豊富な全粒穀物と検査値との間には有意な関連は認められなかった。食事・栄養素摂取に関する指標の達成項目数と検査値との関連については、達成項目数が多い群ほど、BMI、TG が有意に低く、HDLCが有意に高くなる量・反応関係が認められたが、TG や HDLC との関連は BMI で調整すると有意性が消失した。
結論: 本研究は一勤労者集団を対象としたものであるが、我が国においても、食事・栄養素摂取に関する AHA 指標と血圧及び脂質代謝異常との間に有意な関連がみられた。特に魚介類と清涼飲料水の摂取は複数の検査項目の異常と有意な関連を認めたが、そのうち清涼飲料水の摂取との関連は肥満を介することが示唆された。今後、我が国の生活習慣病予防対策を立案する際には、魚介類の摂取不足および清涼飲料水の摂取過多に関連する病態にも着目する必要があると考えられた。

      <title>Positive association between high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese workers: 6‐year follow‐up</title>
      <link>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/crpdm2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://winterwang.github.io/publication/crpdm2/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Background: Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of low-grade systemic inflammation, may be involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether inflammation precedes development of T2DM independent of cigarette smoking and obesity remains to be confirmed.
Methods: We studied 4213 civil servants in a local government in Japan aged 35-66 years at baseline in 2002, who donated blood samples and were followed 6 years.</description>
